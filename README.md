## üìå Docker Lab 2: Build Custom Docker Images

### Task 1: Build Nginx Image

* Write a `Dockerfile` to build an nginx image from **Ubuntu / CentOS / RedHat / OracleLinux / Alpine** base image
* Create a `html` file locally and copy it to your image
* Push the custom image to your repository
* Run a container from your image
* Test with `curl` from your localhost

### Task 2: Build Tomcat Image

* Write a `Dockerfile` to build a tomcat image from **Ubuntu / CentOS / RedHat / OracleLinux / Alpine** base image
* Push the custom image to your repository
* Run a container from your image
* Test with `curl` from your localhost

### Task 3: Build NodeJS Image

* Write a `Dockerfile` to build a NodeJS image from **Ubuntu / CentOS / RedHat / OracleLinux / Alpine** base image
* Push the custom image to your repository
* Run a container from your image
* Test with `curl` from your localhost

## üìå Docker Lab 3: Docker Compose

### Task 1: Install Docker Compose

* Install Docker Compose ‚Üí [Official docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Test installation
* Run `docker-compose version` to check version
* Run `docker-compose --help` to see CLI references

### Task 2: Quick Start with WordPress

* Use Docker Compose to easily run **WordPress** in an isolated environment with Docker containers
* Reference: [WordPress with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/samples/wordpress/)

### Task 3: Real Project ‚Äì NodeJS + MySQL

* Create `Dockerfile` for NodeJS and MySQL images
* Create `docker-compose.yml` to run NodeJS + MySQL services
* Connect NodeJS service to MySQL service
* Display web page on browser

---

## üìå Docker Lab 4: Volumes and Mounts

### Task 1: Volume Mount

* Create a volume named `task1-volume`
* Run an nginx container with the volume mounted at `/opt/mount_point/`
* Use `docker exec` to log into the container and create a file inside the mount point
* Run a second nginx container with the same volume mount
* Use `docker exec` to log into the second container and verify the file exists

### Task 2: Bind Mount

* Create an `index.html` file with custom content
* Run an nginx container mapped to port `80:80`
* Use **bind mount** to mount your local `index.html` to `/usr/share/nginx/html` in the container
* Verify that the web page shows your custom content
* Modify `index.html` in the container and check if it also updates on the host
