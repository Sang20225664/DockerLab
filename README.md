A Docker Lab for self-studying

Docker Lab 1:  Write docker command for following instructions 
	- Check docker version 
	- Search docker images on Docker Hub 
	- Pull nginx latest image from Docker Hub 
	- Show list image on local 
	- Run docker container in detach mode and mapping to port 8080 of local machine 
	- Check running containers 
	- Check all containers (include not running containers) 
	- Stop a container 
	- Start a container 
	- Remote to a running container or run a command in a running container 
	- Tagging a docker image 
Then, finish following task: 
	- Create your own Docker Hub account 
	- Create repository 
	- Push nginx image to your repository 
	- Delete nginx image in your local machine 
	- Try to pull the nginx image from your repository 

 
Docker Lab 2: Build custom docker images for nginx, tomcat, NodeJS 

Task 1: Build nginx image 
	- Write Dockerfile to build a nginx image from ubuntu/centos/redhat/oraclelinux/alpine base image 
	- Create a html file on your local machine and copy to your image 
	- Push image to your repository 
	- Run nginx container from your image 
	- Test curl from your localhost 

Task 2: Build tomcat image 
	- Write Dockerfile to build a tomcat image from ubuntu/centos/redhat/oraclelinux/alpine base image 
	- Push image to your repository 
	- Run tomcat container from your image 
	- Test curl from your localhost 

Task 3: Build NodeJS image 
	- Write Dockerfile to build a NodeJS image from ubuntu/centos/redhat/oraclelinux/alpine base image 
	- Push image to your repository 
	- Run NodeJS container from your image 
	- Test curl from your localhost 
 

Docker Lab 3: Use docker-compose to deploy a mini full-stack web app 

Task 1: Install docker-compose 
	- Install docker-compose following this reference: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ 
	- Test the installation 
	- Run command docker-compose version to check version of docker-compose 
	- Run command docker-compose â€“help to see the cli references 

Task 2: docker-compose quick start 
	- Using Docker Compose to easily run WordPress in an isolated environment built with Docker containers 
	- References: https://docs.docker.com/samples/wordpress/ 

Task 3: Doing a real project including NodeJS and MySQL using docker-compose 
	- Create Dockerfile for building NodeJS and MySQL container image 
	- Create docker-compose file to running NodeJS and mysql service, connect to MySQL service from NodeJS service 
	- Display web page on your browser 
 

Docker Lab 4: Do following tasks 

Task 1: Experiment Volume mount 
	- Create a volume named task1-volume 
	- Run a nginx container with the volume created in step 1 
	- The mount point for container in /opt/mount_point/ 
	- Use docker exec command to log into container, create a file with random content in /opt/mount_point/ 
	- Run a second nginx container with the same mounting point as the first nginx container 
	- Use docker exec command to log into the second nginx container, check if the file created before is in /opt/mount_point/ 

Task 2: Experiment Bind mount 
	- Create an index.html file with the content you preferred 
	- Run a nginx container map to port 80:80 
	- Using bind mount to mount a location of your index.html file to /usr/share/nginx/html in the container 
	- Check if the web content is the content of your html file. 
	- Try modifying the content of index.html file in the container, check if the content of index.html file in your host also change
